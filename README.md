# Project: Daily Content Generator with Personality Chatbot

This project creates a text file that generates random content every day, similar to a daily post.

## Description
The system automatically produces a new text with random information or phrases.  
In addition, the project aims to connect a personalized chatbot that can interact based on previous conversations, simulating the way the real person would respondâ€”without making critical decisions that require full attention.

## Goals
- Practice automating daily content generation.  
- Build and connect a personalized chatbot that reflects natural conversation style.  
- Ensure the chatbot avoids handling sensitive or critical decisions that need human attention.  

## Files
- `main.py` : Main code to generate the daily content and integrate chatbot logic.  
- `post.txt` : Output file where the generated content is stored.  

## Usage
1. Run the `main.py` file.  
2. Check the `post.txt` file to see the newly generated content.  
3. Interact with the chatbot module for simulated conversation responses.
